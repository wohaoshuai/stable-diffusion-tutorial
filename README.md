[Run it Now on Web]
There're multiple ways to run stable diffusion or controlNet or more on the web, you might know one or more of them:

Replicate
https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion
https://replicate.com/jagilley/controlnet

Colab
https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab

[Choice of Local UI]
If you would like to generate tons of images / use customized extensions, it makes total sense to install it locally while it can take a while and you will need a GPU. Here're few popular choices:

Stable Diffusion WebUI
https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

InvokeAI
https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI

Comparsion
Both UIs have great funtionality. The canvas feature of InvokeAI can be quite useful, while WebUI currently has more extension developed by the commuity to support lastest feature faster. 

[Download models]
